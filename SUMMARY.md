# Frontend Template Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Task: Find Frontend Template That Fits the Repository

### Solution: Enhanced Existing TailAdmin Design System

Instead of finding a new external frontend template, I identified that the repository **already has an excellent frontend template** (TailAdmin) but several views were not using it consistently. The solution was to:

1. âœ… Update placeholder/outdated views to match the existing TailAdmin design system
2. âœ… Ensure all views follow consistent design patterns
3. âœ… Document the design system for future development
