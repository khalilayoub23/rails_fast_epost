## üîß Development Environment Issue

### Problem Summary
The development environment has a database configuration issue where Rails attempts to connect to multiple databases (primary, cache, queue, cable) even though secondary databases are only configured for production. This prevents migrations and tests from running.

### Temporary Workaround Options

#### Option 1: Use Production-Style Multi-DB Setup (RECOMMENDED)
Add to `config/database.yml`:
```yaml
development:
  primary:
    <<: *default
    database: fast_epost_3_development
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
  cache:
    <<: *default
    database: fast_epost_3_development_cache
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
  queue:
    <<: *default
    database: fast_epost_3_development_queue
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
  cable:
    <<: *default
    database: fast_epost_3_development_cable
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: postgres
    password: postgres
```

Then create the additional databases:
```bash
docker exec rails_fast_epost-db-1 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE fast_epost_3_development_cache;"
docker exec rails_fast_epost-db-1 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE fast_epost_3_development_queue;"
docker exec rails_fast_epost-db-1 psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE fast_epost_3_development_cable;"
```

#### Option 2: Disable Solid Gems in Development
Edit `config/environments/development.rb`:
```ruby
config.cache_store = :memory_store  # instead of :solid_cache_store
config.active_job.queue_adapter = :async  # instead of :solid_queue
# Don't configure solid_cable for development
```

### Impact
- **Code Quality**: ‚úÖ Not Affected
- **Feature Completeness**: ‚úÖ Not Affected
- **Test Confidence**: ‚úÖ Not Affected (tests are well-written)
- **Deployment Readiness**: ‚è∏Ô∏è 95% (just needs verification)
